This is my first post on this blog so, like in software dev, it is fitting to start with a sort of "Hello world" sort of blog post. That is, I figure I will take a minute to introduce myself.

My name is Brian Broll and I am currently pursuing my PhD at Vanderbilt University for Computer Science (specifically Software and Systems Engineering). My dissertation research is focused on extending _Snap!_ (the educational visual programming language developed at Berkeley) to support distributed systems principles, ie, allowing students to build networked apps (actually using the internet rather than simply broadcasting messages between sprites on the same computer). However, I am also interested in lowering the barrier to entry for deep learning and generally increasing productivity for software development.

Aside from tech, I enjoy doing one armed pullups, unicycling and hanging out with my wife :)
